# SVG Path Closer

## Shared customer-access foundation

`index.html` is the GitHub Pages-compatible SVG Micro Eco hub. It restores the
same browser session used by PathSeal, renders tool cards from
`modules/productManifest.js`, and derives presentation states in
`modules/accessFoundation.js`. Only implemented, production-enabled manifest
entries may appear in selection/quote controls. A manifest entry never enables
backend checkout by itself.

Focused tool links are physical `.html` files. Login return destinations are
accepted only when they exactly match the implemented route registry; invalid,
external, encoded, planned, or query-bearing destinations fall back to the hub.
Tool 2's existing scan/removal/download behavior is intentionally unchanged in
Phase 1. The common repair/download gating boundary remains a Phase 2 policy
decision. No subscription-management link is shown until its destination is
verified.

SVG Path Closer is a browser-based CNC utility that detects and repairs open paths in SVG files.

It is the first standalone micro-tool in the SVG Micro Eco repair system.

## MVP Goals

* Upload an SVG file
* Detect open paths
* Repair gaps and micro-gaps
* Export a cleaned SVG
* Display a repair summary

## Planned Workflow

Upload → Scan → Fix → Validate → Download
## Project Structure

- `index.html` — page structure and user controls
- `styles.css` — visual layout and styling
- `app.js` — connects the interface to the repair module
- `modules/pathCloser.js` — reusable SVG scanning and repair logic
- `test-open-path.svg` — repairable micro-gap test
- `test-closed-path.svg` — already-closed path test
- `test-large-gap.svg` — intentional open-path test
- `test-multiple-paths.svg` — mixed geometry test
- `test-broken.svg` — malformed SVG test

## Current Repair Logic

1. Read the uploaded SVG as text.
2. Parse the SVG into an editable document.
3. Extract every `<path>` element.
4. Determine whether each path ends with `Z`.
5. Measure the distance between each path’s endpoints.
6. Compare the gap against that path’s total length.
7. Classify the opening as a micro-gap, gap, or large gap.
8. Automatically close safe gaps by appending `Z`.
9. Skip large gaps that may be intentional geometry.
10. Validate and serialize the repaired SVG.
11. Offer the cleaned SVG for download.

## MVP Safety Rules

- Micro-gap: endpoint distance is at most 0.5% of path length
- Repairable gap: endpoint distance is at most 2% of path length
- Large gap: greater than 2% and skipped automatically
- Already-closed paths are left unchanged
- Invalid SVG files are rejected without crashing the app

## Current Workflow

1. Upload an SVG file.
2. Scan all path elements.
3. Review the scan summary.
4. Open the detected-path review.
5. Inspect numbered repair candidates.
6. Select or deselect proposed closures.
7. Preview highlighted paths and dotted closure bridges.
8. Repair the selected paths.
9. Preview and validate the repaired SVG.
10. Download the cleaned SVG.

## Tool 2 foundation: Duplicate Line Remover

`duplicate-geometry.html` is the minimal shared-chassis entry point for the
reserved `duplicate_geometry` engine. It scans SVG `<line>` elements and
produces safe-removal proposals that retain the first canonical instance,
including when a matching line's endpoints are reversed.

The foundation is deliberately conservative. Coordinates must be finite,
unitless SVG numbers. Lines must share the same parent and have identical
non-coordinate attributes and have no direct reference attributes. Exact
geometry with different styling, nesting, metadata, or IDs is reported for
customer review and is not removed. Paths and curves, near matches, partial
overlaps, and tolerance-based matches are left untouched. Unsupported line
coordinates are reported as skipped. This is not
an entitlement, checkout, package, or live-product activation.

The review screen identifies the line retained, the duplicate proposed for
removal, its exact endpoints, and the safety reason. Safe proposals are
individually selectable. Questionable matches are visible but disabled and
remain unchanged. Output is generated only after explicit confirmation.

Later tools may add their own engines beside `modules/duplicateGeometry.js`.
They must not broaden this exact-match contract into stray-node, overlap, or
curve repair, and must not alter PathSeal's review-before-repair behavior.
